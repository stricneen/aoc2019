I have chosen art and design as i am extremely passionate about it.

I love doing art in my free time whilst being inspired by various artists such as Banksey and Jean Michel Basquiat as their art is not only visualy stunning but also have meaningful messages behind them.
In my spare time I also enjoy going to art gallerys such as Manchester art galllery and Contempary Six to gather more interesting ideas for my next art peice.
I am open to try any different art styles and aproach art with a very open mind as also taking insparation from L.S Lowery and Dean Entwistle as these two artists particularly stand out to me because of there unique art styles.
I enjoy being out doors, looking for more creativity and ideas I can implement into my art work, lookimg for ideas id go to Affleks or go to idiosyncratic resteraunts or caf√©'s.


Thank you for your time, hope to hear from you soon
